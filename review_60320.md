# i) Interest of Content
Content seems unrelated to computing, and some pages are empty of content entirely

# ii) Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
Style is consistent, but not aesthetically pleasing. Not enough content to provide an accurate ranking, as there is only 1 other page outside the home page

# iii) Quality of Written Presentation
There is very little written content, witch while of reasonable quality, is far too sparse.

# iv) Validity of HTML
All images except 1 have been incorrectly linked, so do not display.
The Javascript file does not laod correctly
The other HTML elements are valid

# v) Evidence of Collaboration
